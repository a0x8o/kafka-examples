# Confluent Examples

This repository contains code examples for [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) and the
[Confluent Platform](http://www.confluent.io/product).

* **[kafka-clients](kafka-clients/)**: example Kafka client applications such as a Java producer application
  (for writing data to Kafka) and a Java consumer application (for reading data from Kafka)
* **[kafka-connect-streams](kafka-connect-streams/)**: examples that demonstrate various ways to get data into a Kafka topic,
   loaded into the Kafka Streams API `KStream`, and then some basic usage of the Kafka stream processing API

Kafka Streams examples have moved to a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-streams-examples).
